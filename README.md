Tools for re-making Pokemon TCG card scans.

## svrestyle: older cards -> Scarlet & Violet / Mega Evolution look

Give it TCGdex card ids; it picks the layout from the card:
- **Pokemon V** (Sword & Shield Basic V) -> **Scarlet & Violet ex**: the old frame and text are removed and the art
  rebuilt (LaMa inpainting), then the SV frame for the card's type, Gill Sans lettering, ex logo, rule box and footer
  are set from the card's real data.
- **Regular Pokemon** (Sun & Moon, Sword & Shield; Basic, Stage 1, Stage 2) -> **Mega Evolution regular card**: the art
  window moves over as is (it sits in the same place in all three eras), a Stage card's old evolution portrait is
  inpainted out and its pre-evolution picture moved into the Mega Evolution portrait ring, and the card is set on a
  blank Mega Evolution frame of its type with name, HP, Pokedex line, abilities/attacks, weakness row, flavour text
  and footer.

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt            # torch: --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
export SVRESTYLE_FONTS=/path/to/gill-sans  # licensed fonts, not in this repo
python -m svrestyle prepare                # once: model + reference scans + frame assets (~/.cache/svrestyle)
python -m svrestyle card swsh6-99 --no-attacks          # Galarian Slowking V -> ex, full art, no attacks
python -m svrestyle card swsh9-040 swsh1-138 --style panel
python -m svrestyle card swsh3-88 sm10-19 sma-SV33      # Tyranitar, Kartana, Shiny Vault Kartana -> Mega Evolution
python -m unittest discover tests
```

Options: `--style hybrid` (default, art behind the text) or `panel` (SV translucent type panel) - ex only;
`--no-attacks`; `--debug` (ex: mask overlay + JSON report); `--out DIR`.

Supported types: Grass, Fire, Water, Lightning, Psychic, Fighting, Darkness, Metal, Dragon, Colorless (no Fairy:
neither target era has a Fairy frame). Tested on the ex side with swsh6-99, swsh9-040, swsh1-138, swsh4-43, swsh3-19,
swsh7-110, swsh8-113, swsh1-1, swsh1-141, swsh10-078, swsh3-99, swsh12.5-065, swshp-SWSH055, swsh10-101, swsh6-58,
swsh6-80, swsh6-97; on the Mega Evolution side with 22 Sun & Moon / Sword & Shield cards (all types but Lightning),
and checked against real me1 cards re-set by the same code (within 1-4 px).

How it works, module by module:
- `swsh.py` - masks the V frame regions; finds the text block by its white glyphs with a black keyline, the
  Ability badge by colour, and cost icons by circle detection on their fixed slots; LaMa rebuilds the art.
- `frame.py` - builds the SV frame from real scans (`refs.py`): border, window bar, weakness row and rule box
  (type-independent), and per type the name bar (name/HP removed), energy icon, panel palette and ink colour.
- `compose.py` / `typeset.py` - lays out name, HP, abilities, attacks (justified effect text, italic reminder
  text, damage), weakness row and footer, with constants measured on SV scans.
- `meframe.py` - blank Mega Evolution frames: Mega Evolution cards of one type share the same bar, panel and footer
  texture, so each printed pixel of a base card is taken from another card of the type that has nothing printed
  there (LaMa only for what every card covers); plus the silver Stage 1 / Stage 2 pieces from Kadabra and Alakazam.
- `mecompose.py` - the Mega Evolution layout: art window, portrait, Pokedex line (PokeAPI), the vertical spacing of
  abilities and attacks fitted on 45 me1 cards, flavour text; text drawing is shared with `compose.py`.

For Claude Code sessions on this repo the `sv-restyle` skill (`.claude/skills/sv-restyle/SKILL.md`) runs this.

## Older one-off scripts
`mask-alakazam-ex-mew-065.py` + `lama-inpaint.py`: text removal for Alakazam ex (151 #065); see `HANDOFF.md`.
